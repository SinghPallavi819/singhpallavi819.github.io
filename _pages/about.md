    <p class="hero-subtitle">
      I am a cybersecurity graduate student with a strong foundation in software development,
      now transitioning fully into defensive security. My interest lies in understanding how
      systems behave under attack, how threats surface in logs, and how security teams detect,
      analyze, and respond to real incidents.
    </p>

    <p class="hero-subtitle">
      I learn cybersecurity by doing. I actively solve hands-on challenges, analyze logs,
      build detections, and document my findings clearly. I believe strong security comes from
      curiosity, consistency, and the ability to explain complex issues in simple terms.

      <h3>Community & Practice</h3>
      <p>
        I am an active member of <b>Women in Cybersecurity (WiCyS)</b> and regularly engage
        in cybersecurity communities to learn, share, and grow.
      </p>
      <p>
        I practice cybersecurity daily through <b>TryHackMe</b>, where I solve challenges,
        complete labs, and continuously strengthen my understanding of real-world attack and
        defense scenarios.

  <h2>Academic Focus & Training</h2>
  <p>
    I am currently pursuing a Master’s degree in Computer Science with a strong focus on
    cybersecurity. My coursework emphasizes defensive security, threat analysis, system-level
    understanding, and data-driven security decisions.

  <h2>How I Approach Security</h2>
  <ol class="clean-list">
    <li>Understand systems, assets, and log sources</li>
    <li>Think like an attacker to identify realistic abuse scenarios</li>
    <li>Write detections and validate them with data</li>
    <li>Correlate signals across multiple tools</li>
    <li>Document incidents clearly and thoughtfully</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Beyond Cybersecurity</h2>
  <p>
    Outside of security, I enjoy reading books, cooking, and listening to music. These hobbies
    help me stay creative, balanced, and focused—skills that also influence how I approach
    problem-solving in cybersecurity.
