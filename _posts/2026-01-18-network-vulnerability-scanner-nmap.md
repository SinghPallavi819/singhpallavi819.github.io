## Overview
This project is a simple Python-based command-line tool that runs Nmap vulnerability scans to identify open ports and highlight potential security issues for initial vulnerability awareness.

## Goal
Gain hands-on understanding of how vulnerability scanners work by automating Nmap scans and reviewing vulnerability-related outputs.

## Tools Used
- Python  
- Nmap  
- python-nmap  

## How It Works
- Automatically identifies the target IP address  
- Runs Nmap using `--script vuln`  
- Enumerates open ports and protocols  
- Flags ports where Nmap vulnerability scripts return findings  

## Key Concept
Nmap vulnerability scripts are based on known security issues and often reference CVEs.  
This tool surfaces those results to support **initial CVE awareness**, not exploitation.

## What I Learned
- How Nmap detects open ports and exposed services
- How vulnerability scripts surface known security issues
- How security scanning supports early-stage triage
